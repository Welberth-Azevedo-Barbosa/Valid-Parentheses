# Valid-Parentheses
Solution for leetcode  "Valid Parentheses"

The "isValid" function uses a stack-based approach to check the validity of the opening and closing character sequence. It iterates through the character sequence, adding opening characters to the stack and checking if the closing characters match correctly with the last opening characters in the stack. Finally, it checks if the stack is empty to determine the validity of the sequence.
